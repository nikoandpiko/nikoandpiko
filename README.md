### はじめまして 👋
## How's it going?

🔭 My name's Nick, and I am a software engineer. [Portfolio](https://www.nikoandpiko.me/ "Nick Roma's Portfolio") / [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikoandpiko/ "LinkedIn")

🔔 Currently contributing tests to larger projects and providing better alternatives to outdated application components.

👯 I’m looking for opportunites to build things with others! Drop me a line!

👄 私は日本語が話せます。

🌱 I’m also learning to do SVG animations on the side. [See some samples](https://codepen.io/collection/DLokav "codepen sample collection")

⚡ I was a teacher ([成蹊学園](https://www.seikei.ac.jp/gakuen/ "成蹊学園")、[成城学園](https://www.seijogakuen.ed.jp/chukou/ "成城学園")など) and [test developer](https://www.benesse.co.jp/gtec/ "GTEC"), spending my free time coding on the side. From here on out, it's a coding lifestyle.

👨‍🎓 I received my Master's from [Temple University](https://www.tuj.ac.jp/tesol/index.html "Temple TESOL Program").

😄 Besides code, the other loves of my life are my family and cars (see below).

###### ※ This [Ferrari](https://www.ferrari.com/en-PS/auto/ferrari-roma "Ferrari Roma") gets extra points because we both share the same name.
