### はじめまして 👋
## How's it going?

🔭 My name's Nick and I love Rails!

🌱 I’m currently learning what one can achieve with SVG and animations!

👯 I’m looking for people to build things with!

😄 Besides code, the other loves of my life are my family and cars.

⚡ Fun fact: I was a teacher and test developer for the past decade.
