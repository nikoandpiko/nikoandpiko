### はじめまして 👋
## How's it going?

🔭 My name's Nick and I *love* Rails! → [My LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikoandpiko/ "LinkedIn")

🔔 My specialties include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, MVC, TDD, Figma, etc.

🌱 I’m currently learning what one can achieve with SVG and animations! [See some samples](https://codepen.io/collection/DLokav "codepen")

👯 I’m looking for people to build things with!

👄 私は日本語が話せます。

⚡ Fun fact: I was a teacher and test developer for the past decade.

😄 Besides code, the other loves of my life are my family and cars.
